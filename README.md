# G5-Web-Track-TodoApp-React

This is a simple todos web app done using react and typescript. Users can add todos, edit, toggle status of tasks or delete them. It stores the todos in memory so if the page is refreshed, they will be lost.

In this project I have used typescript to harness its static type checking capability.
